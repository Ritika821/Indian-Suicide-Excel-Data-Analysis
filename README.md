# Indian-Suicide-Excel-Data-Analysis


## Introduction :

This project is about the suicide rate in India and comparison between the different states and union territories of India of the year 2022. Suicide is a major national public health issue in the India. 1.71 lakh suicides were recorded in 2022, registering a 4.2% increase over 2021 and a jump of 27% compared to 2018. The rate of suicide per one lakh population has increased to 12.4 in 2022 which is the highest year for this data. Suicides during 2022 increased by 27% in comparison to 2018 with India reporting highest number of suicides in the world. The male-to-female suicide ratio in 2021 was 72.5 : 27.4. This Report will help us to know the official rate of suicide in India and the number of male and female suicide rate, the status of the person, and mode or methods of suicide also the different causes of suicide. I have also calculated the rate of suicide by dividing number of suicides by total population. Through this I have compared between the States and UTs and also between the year 2018-2022.

## Conclusion :

Suicide is a complex and multifaceted issue in India, shaped by a variety of socio-economic, psychological, and cultural factors. High levels of stress due to unemployment, academic pressure, family conflicts, mental health disorders, financial instability, and the stigma around seeking psychological help contribute to the country's suicide rates. Vulnerable groups include farmers, students, and young people, particularly those experiencing social isolation or pressure. Through the help of this report we can analyse that day by day the suicide rate is increasing as the human pressure and responsibilities is increasing. We found that the person with less or lack of resources are the highest among the self-killers, the youngsters with lots of pressure due to competitions, education problem, resources, relationships etc. are also have top level in suicide rate and the married person who have huge number of responsibilities and family problem are the top members among the suicide victim. This report will help us to prevent the suicide problem from our close ones by focusing upon the top section of the victims. Through this we can be able to reduce the rate of Suicide in India.
